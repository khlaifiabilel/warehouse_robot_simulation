# delivery_robot_simulation

This project is under development. This project will be presented as the "Capstone Project" of Udacity C++ Engineer Nanodegree.

- Next Step: Documentation

# Development Process

Plan the solution, design a first draft of the components, classes

Design the warehouse simplified map

Design the delivery robot with a container for the packages on the rear side

Develop a ROS node that spawn/remove gazebo objects in the world -> Test the package beeing picking and drop-off in the robot's container

Map the warehouse with the delivery robot

Test AMCL and Navigation stack, based on the final project of the Udacity Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree

Define the picking points and model representation in the world

Define Drop-off points and model representation in the world

Build an UI screen in opencv to accept mouse clicks and show operation numbers

Build the warehouse controller node
